    <div class="py-2 text-lg">
        I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Cornell, specializing in machine learning with a focus on large language models. I earned my B.E. from <a href="https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm" style="color: #003366;">Xinya College</a>, the liberal arts college at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" style="color: #003366;">Tsinghua University</a>. 
        
        <br><br>

        Thanks to the Open Curriculum at Xinya College, I had the opportunity to explore my interests in a wide range of fields—Computer Science, Statistics, and Design—before ultimately dedicating myself to machine learning.
        
        <br><br>

        Beyond academics, I’m passionate about volleyball and played on Tsinghua University's Volleyball Team (Non-Athlete Specialization). I also love film photography and enjoy visiting art galleries.
