        I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Cornell, specializing in machine learning with a focus on large language models. I earned my B.E. from <a href="https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm" style="color: #003366;">Xinya College</a>, the liberal arts college at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" style="color: #003366;">Tsinghua University</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being mentored by <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/" style="color: #003366;">Prof. Quanquan Gu</a> at the <a href="https://www.uclaml.org/" style="color: #003366;">UCLA Artificial General Intelligence Lab</a> during a summer internship. I was also fortunate to work under the guidance of <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/" style="color: #003366;">Prof. Yuntao Wang</a> and <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zengjy/" style="color: #003366;">Prof. Jianyang Zeng</a> at Tsinghua University.

        Thanks to the Open Curriculum at Xinya College, I had the opportunity to explore my interests in a wide range of fields—Computer Science, Statistics, and Design—before ultimately dedicating myself to machine learning.

        Beyond academics, I’m passionate about volleyball and played on Tsinghua University's Volleyball Team (Non-Athlete Specialization). I also love film photography and enjoy visiting art galleries.
